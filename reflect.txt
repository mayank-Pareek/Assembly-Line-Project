This project taught me how to create a program that simulates an assembly line with workstations filling customer orders. By dividing the project into three smaller parts, it was easier to work on and understand the complex tasks involved. The assembly line had different workstations with their own stock items. I learned how to use object-oriented programming to create organized and easy-to-maintain code. I also discovered the importance of using data structures like vectors and queues to manage customer orders.
The project made me think about managing limited resources, like the stock items at each station. This is important because it relates to real-life situations in industries that need to manage inventory and supply chains. Overall, this project helped me learn about programming, resource management, and software testing. The skills I gained will be useful in future projects. The assembly line simulation also gave me insight into the challenges of creating programs that model real-world systems and the importance of planning and organizing to solve those challenges.
